## For loop programs

7.Write a program that takes a command-line argument n and prints a table of the
  powers of 2 that are less than or equal to 2^n.

8.Write a program that takes a command-line argument n and prints the nth harmonic
  number. Harmonic Number is of the form
    Hn=(1/1)+(1/2)+(1/3)+(1/4)+....(1/n)

9.Write a program that takes a input and determines if the number is a prime.

10.Extend the program to take a range of number as input and output the Prime
   Numbers in that range.

11.Write a program that computes a factorial of a number taken as input.
   Factorial â€“ 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5

12.Write a program to compute Factors of a number N using prime factorization method.
   Logic -> Traverse till i*i<= N instead of i <= N for efficiency.
   0/P -> Print the prime factors of number N.
